The midterm exam will be in class {% include exam_on_from_to %}.

# Rules

Phones off!
You may use notes or written materials (1 8.5"x11" paper, both sides), 
but no electronic devices of any kind. 
You won't need to do any complicated numerical calculations,
and if we ask you for Python code we won't mark it off for
exact syntax or details of argument lists.

Write your answers legibly within the space provided.
