Note: You will get full credit for this homework just by handing it in.

The purpose of the quiz is to review some of the math background
for the class, and to help you decide if there is anything you want to
brush up on.  If any of these questions baffles you,
it will be easier to pick up the concept right now than struggle with it
later.  The T.As will answer questions about the quiz in discussion section.
